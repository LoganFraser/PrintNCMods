This modifies the great case by mikemacwillie from here:

I've moved the cover to the rear of the case to make it easier to install the screen and heatset screw inserts.  

There's a screen brace that holds the screen into the case.

This is a collection of mounts for storage of the jog2k, button pcb, and wireless or small keyboard (I use a Logitech K400)
